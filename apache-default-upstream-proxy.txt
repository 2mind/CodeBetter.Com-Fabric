########## Backend Apache
# This apache only listens on localhost to port 8200.
# It also has php and mod_rpaf installed. It does not gzip/deflate or access.log. It *Does* error log.
# Basically, your backend apache is fairly normal. You should disable keepalive too by setting
# Keepalive Off
# in your main config.
# mod_rpaf allows your backend apache to see the real IP address of the request, instead of the address of 
# your frontend proxy.
